      I'm a third-year Computer Science student studying deep learning and quantum computing. I'm fascinated by the fact that DL&QC brings maths to life and allows us to compute things that don't seem to be computable. I create projects, which challenges me to move outside of my comfort zone since even if I fail, I will have learnt a lot from it. Beyond that, I love building cool stuff simply because it's exciting to bring ideas to life and see them work. Other than academics and projects, I play a lot of video games for fun and sometimes design them. Iâ€™m also a public speaker and storyteller, enjoying the chance to connect with people and share engaging stories.

I am actively looking for internships and opportunities where I can learn a lot and where the team is motivated not only by money but also by the desire to create something awesome for people to use. I bring a strong work ethic, creativity, and a drive to tackle challenging problems.
